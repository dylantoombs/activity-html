    <p>Yoshi can use his long tongue to eat almost any type of enemy, including foes Mario and Luigi could not defeat on their own. If an enemy hits Yoshi, he runs away, leaving Mario or Luigi behind. However, they can jump back on Yoshi's saddle to take control of Yoshi once more. Yoshi is unable to enter Ghost Houses (except the Sunken Ghost Ship), Fortresses, the castles of the Koopalings, and the castle of King Bowser. Yoshi waits outside for them to return. When riding Yoshi, there are added drums to the music, a detail that was added to most games where Yoshi is ridable.</p>
