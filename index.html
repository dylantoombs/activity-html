    <p><strong>Yoshi</strong> can use his long tongue to eat almost any type of enemy, including foes <em>Mario and Luigi</em> could not defeat on their own. If an enemy hits <strong>Yoshi</strong>, he runs away, leaving <em>Mario or Luigi</em> behind. However, they can jump back on <strong>Yoshi's</strong> saddle to take control of <Strong>Yoshi</Strong> once more. <strong>Yoshi</strong> is unable to enter Ghost Houses (except the Sunken Ghost Ship), Fortresses, the castles of the <em>Koopalings</em>, and the castle of <em>King Bowser.</em> <strong>Yoshi</strong> waits outside for them to return. When riding <strong>Yoshi</strong>, there are added drums to the music, a detail that was added to most games where <strong>Yoshi</strong> is ridable.</p>
